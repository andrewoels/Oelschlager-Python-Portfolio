# Oelschlager-Python-Portfolio 🐍

A collection of interactive Python projects built using Streamlit, pandas, and related libraries. This portfolio showcases my ability to design, build, and deploy intuitive data-driven applications with strong UI/UX principles. Each project is linked to a dedicated GitHub repository and reflects my design-driven approach to problem solving, with emphasis on storytelling, customization, and interactivity.

### 👨‍💻 Projects

🐧 [Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/andrewoels/Oelschlager-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app) – An introductory project that classifies penguin species based on key features. This project aims to demonstrate a beginner understanding of Streamlit and its interactive functions.

- 🔧 **Skills Demonstrated**: user-friendly filtering interface, data visualization.

🏅 [Tidy Data App](https://github.com/andrewoels/Oelschlager-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/tidy-data-project) – A project that provides an interactive dashboard for exploring and visualizing Olympic medalist data from the 2008 games using tidy data principles. This project continues to highlight use of Streamlit as well as cleaning and organizing complex data using tidy data principles.

- 🔧 **Skills Demonstrated**: Data wrangling (melt/pivot), tidy data format, interactive visual analytics.

🧠 [Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) App](https://github.com/andrewoels/Oelschlager-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/named-entity-recognition-app) – A project that allows you to define custom entity labels and patterns with spaCy’s built-in NER pipeline, creating a model that recognizes both standard and user-defined entities. This project highlights a continued use and understanding of Streamlit in addition to concepts like natural language processing.
- 🔧 **Skills Demonstrated**: Natural Language Processing (spaCy), regex pattern matching, custom UI components, real-time visualization.

🏈 [Madden NFL 25 Player Ratings Visualizer](https://github.com/andrewoels/Oelschlager-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/streamlit-app-final) – A Streamlit-based web application that helps users scout, compare, and shortlist players based on Madden NFL 25 ratings. Designed for franchise mode enthusiasts, the app enables users to filter by archetype, position, and physical attributes, then visualize key performance stats using interactive spider and bar charts. This project reflects my interest in sports analytics and digital product design, blending intuitive UI with data-driven decision-making.
- 🔧 **Skills Demonstrated**: Streamlit interface design, data filtering logic, dynamic charting with Plotly, CSV integration, frontend customization.
