# Oelschlager-Python-Portfolio 🐍

📂 **A collection of Python projects from my computing classes at the University of Notre Dame**  
💻 **Goal of these projects is to showcase proficiency with Python**  

### 👨‍💻 Projects
- 🐧 [Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/andrewoels/Oelschlager-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app) – An introductory project that classifies penguin species based on key features. This project aims to demonstrate a beginner understanding of Streamlit and its interactive functions.
- 🏅 [Tidy Data App](https://github.com/andrewoels/Oelschlager-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/tidy-data-project) – A project that provides an interactive dashboard for exploring and visualizing Olympic medalist data from the 2008 games using tidy data principles. This project continues to highlight use of Streamlit as well as cleaning and organizing complex data using tidy data principles.
- 🧠 [Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) App](https://github.com/andrewoels/Oelschlager-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/named-entity-recognition-app) – A project that allows you to define custom entity labels and patterns with spaCy’s built-in NER pipeline, creating a model that recognizes both standard and user-defined entities. This project highlights a continued use and understanding of Streamlit in addition to concepts like natural language processing.

### 🚀 What's Next?  
- Future projects will be added and organized as they are completed.  
- Stay tuned to see what I work on!
