# 🏈 Madden NFL 25 Player Ratings Visualizer

Welcome to the Madden NFL 25 Player Ratings Visualizer — a Streamlit-based web application that helps franchise mode players find, compare, and organize players who best fit their team's strategy. Whether you're rebuilding a dynasty or scouting for undervalued gems, this app makes it easier to manage rosters like a real NFL front office.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This app solves a critical challenge in Madden franchise mode: quickly identifying players who fit a custom team scheme without manually sorting through overwhelming rosters. 

The app enables users to:
- Scout top players by specific archetypes to find the perfect scheme fit.
- Sort and interact by individual attribute for maximum detail. 
- Search and filter players by position, team, and overall rating.
- Visually compare selected players' detailed attributes using dynamic spider and bar charts.
- Save custom-built player lists for future use.


Built for gamers who want smarter, data-driven team management with a real-world scouting feel.
